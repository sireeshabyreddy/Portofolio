         Hello! I am Byreddy Sireesha, a passionate and driven Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student currently in my 4th year of B.Tech. My journey so far has been a mix of learning, projects, and honing my skills in software development, data science, machine learning, and database management. I have a strong foundation in various programming technologies, including React, Flask, Django, SQL, AWS, and Git, along with data science libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
                </p>When I am not coding or learning, I like to engage in activities such as crafting, reading storybooks, solving Sudoku, and playing chess. I also enjoy challenges, which is why I frequently participate in coding challenges on HackerRank and LeetCode.
                I am currently seeking internship opportunities in software development and preparing for campus interviews.My aim is to leverage my skills in solving real-world problems and contributing to innovative projects. I'm eager to continuously improve and apply my knowledge in meaningful ways.
